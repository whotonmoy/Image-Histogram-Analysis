Image Histogram Analysis: Generating Histogram and Cumulative Histogram for Input Images

This program analyzes input images by computing and displaying two types of histograms: the histogram, which shows the frequency distribution of pixel intensities, and the cumulative histogram, which illustrates the cumulative frequency of pixel intensities.

This was an assignment that I did in my second to last semester(Fall 2023) for Image Processing Course (CS 425).
